Hi 👋, I'm Aritra Saha

A passionate developer, researcher, and problem solver.

I'm a computer science graduate student at Georgia Tech (4.0 GPA) specializing in Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction. Currently, I develop intelligent systems and high-scale data pipelines, with a focus on "Cognitive Scaffolding" to make complex information accessible. My recent projects include:

**PaperPilot**: A spatial research platform using local Ollama models and Graph-RAG to visualize research papers as interactive knowledge maps.

**SafeSheet**: A database reliability tool that acts as a "flight simulator" for SQL, generating idempotent rollbacks to prevent accidental data loss.

**Leit**: An AI-enhanced Canvas LTI 1.3 platform that automates study workflows and flashcard generation for thousands of students.

**ChatGT**: A private, on-device LLM platform designed to provide secure ML assistance for university coursework.

Passionate about creating intuitive, user-centric solutions that bridge the gap between human cognition and complex data. I have a proven track record of processing 100M+ data points and optimizing systems for <200ms p95 latency.
